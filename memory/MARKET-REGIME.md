  "summary": "US equity markets face a cautious, mixed regime characterized by elevated valuations meeting hawkish Fed signals, geopolitical headwinds, and earnings-dependent volatility. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq declined 0.5% and 0.9% respectively on Tuesday amid OpenAI concerns and Iran tensions. Wednesday futures showed modest gains (Dow +0.1%, S&P 500 +0.1%, Nasdaq +0.3%) ahead of the Fed decision, but the market is 'priced for perfection' with limited room for disappointment in mega-cap tech earnings. Implied volatility suggests 77 basis points of expected movement on Fed day, rising to 115 basis points on the earnings-heavy session following. Risk-off sentiment dominates despite 81% of reported S&P 500 companies beating expectations.",

      "Monitor Fed statement language closely: Any additional hawkish signals could trigger sharp equity selloff; watch for rate-cut removal language",
      "Use earnings volatility for mean reversion: 81% beat rate suggests market may overreact to any miss; consider contrarian entries on sharp intraday declines",
      "Hedge geopolitical tail risk: Oil prices and Iran tensions remain binary; consider reducing long exposure or adding energy hedges",
      "Avoid chasing record highs: Valuation compression risk is real; wait for pullbacks to enter tech positions"
